## tree module
If you just want to learn how to implement functions on a tree structure in Elm, this is for you!
I googled around but did not find ones except core/Dict.elm that use RED-BLACK tree which was complicated 
for just learning. So I created this tree module. 

### Install elm-test
```shell
npm i elm-test
```

### Run it!
```shell
elm-test
```
